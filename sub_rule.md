# Idea:
We have a set of `N` variables `Œ±={Œ±_1,Œ±_2,...,Œ±_N}` minus the identity.
We define the set of substitutions of degree m with the tensor `T^m[i_1,i_2,...,i_m]` such that
`Œ±_{i_1}*Œ±_{i_2}*...Œ±_{i_m}=T^m[i_1,i_2,...,i_m]`.
The number of elements of the tensor is `N^m`.
The general substitution will work by iterating over all indices of the tensor for all the specified degrees m  the `sub_monomial()` function

`sub_monomial(mon1,Œ±_{i_1}*Œ±_{i_2}*...Œ±_{i_m},T^m_{i_1,i_2,...,i_m},recursive=true);`.

It has to be iterated until no possible substitutions are found.

**Deciding when to stop is critical**, we can easily fall in cyclical substitutions.
  ***example 1***
  We define
  ‚Ä¢`Œ±   = [x,y,z]`
  ‚Ä¢`T^1 = [y,x,z]`
  ‚Ä¢`mon1= x`
  then we have the following chain
  ‚Ä¢_first iteration_ `x‚Üíy‚Üíx`
  ‚Ä¢_second iteration_ `x‚Üíy‚Üíx`
  ‚Ä¢...
  This is because there was a _closed path of substitutions_. **This must be avoided**.
  How can we avoid it? There is any theory for it?

üí°If the degree of each element of `T^m[i_1,i_2,‚Ä¶,i_m]` is strictly smaller than `m` then we do not have closed  path of substitutions. This can be a first rudimentary check, but we are not considering all the possible substitutions, see next example.

  ***example 2***
  We define
  ‚Ä¢`Œ±   = [x,y,z]`
  ‚Ä¢`T^1 = [y,_,_]`
  ‚Ä¢`mon1= x`
  where `_` indicates that no substitutions are applied. Then we have the following chain
  ‚Ä¢_first iteration_ `x‚Üíy`
  Here there are no closed path of substitutions in `T^1`.

‚ùìThere exist an algorithm for checking if there are closed paths and in case decide how to open them?



# First physical example:
We consider the vector of Pauli operators `Œ±={X,Y,Z}`.
We indicate with `[A,B]` and `{A,B}` respectively the commutator and anticommutator of `A` and `B`.
The commutation and anticommutation rules of this set are known.
Given `[Œ±_1,Œ±_2]` and `{Œ±_1,Œ±_2}` we know that `Œ±_1*Œ±_2=([Œ±_1,Œ±_2]+{Œ±_1,Œ±_2})/2`.
The set of substitutions of degree `1` is
```
T^1=[_,_,_]
```
We can then build the set of substitutions of degree `2`:
```
        1   +iZ   -iY
T^2 = -iZ     1    iX
       iY   -iX     1
```
The degree of the elements of `T` is at most `1` thus there are no cyclic paths.
We can use it.


# Second physical example:
We consider the vector of Pauli operators `Œ±={X_1,Y_1,Z_1,X_2,Y_2,Z_2}`.
The set of substitutions of degree `2` is the direct sum of the set of substitutions
of order `2` for `Œ±_1={X_1,Y_1,Z_1}` `T^2_1` and the set of substitutions of order `2`
for ¬†`Œ±_2={X_2,Y_2,Z_2}` `T^2_2`. This sparsity should be exploited for bigger systems.
