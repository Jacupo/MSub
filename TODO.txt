- EXTENSION
-- It should be nice to be able to substitute commuting variables in NC monomials
-- for example for fermions one have a†*a=δ-a*a† where a and a† are PolyVar{false}
-- and δ is a PolyVar{true}.
-- Unfortunately if I try to compute δ*a with DynamicPolynomials I obtain the error:
---- ERROR: StackOverflowError:
---- Stacktrace:
---- [1] mapexponents(::Function, ::Monomial{true}, ::Monomial{false})
---- at /Users/jacoposurace/.julia/dev/MultivariatePolynomials/src/monomial.jl:123 (repeats 80000 times)

- SPECIAL CASE
-- sub_monomial(x*y*x*y*x, x*y*x, z)?
--- note: in the for loop, for the commuting case, we want to sub x2*y in x3*y2
--- and in the code we find the degree of x2*y in x3*y2 which is 1. then we
--- apply sub_monomial(x3*y2, x2^deg,1) giving x*y2. to this we do the same for y
--- giving sub_monomial(x*y2, y^deg, 1) which ideally should give x*y, but the
--- function applies the substitution twice, so we end up with x. the end result
--- is x*z instead of the correct x*y*z.

- WHICH DEFAULT?
-- maybe we should just leave as default the recursive version
-- of the substitution for Non commuting variables that is,
---- sub_monomial(xxyy,xy,yx,recursive=true)=yyxx <-leave this as default
---- sub_monomial(xxyy,xy,yx,recursive=false)=xyxy <-not this
-- it make more sense for our final aim.
